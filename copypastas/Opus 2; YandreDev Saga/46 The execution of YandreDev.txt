After seventy years, you finally stumbled upon him - YandreDev. You had been working the German government for seventy years now, attempting to hunt this criminal ever since the raping's of '21 - over 1050 girls, mainly, had been relocated to YandreDev's camps, groomed, raped, and left to die. It was your job to find him and bring him to justice, no matter the cost.

Over the years you had missed funerals, weddings, and celebrations from both friends and family just to capture this man, and every time he, like a skilled serpent, slithered out of your hands. The first time you saw him, he merely shot boiling cum into your eye with a cum gun and left without a trace; you still were an eye-patch to this day.

Now here he was, weak, old and frail. He looked up at you with a nervous smile and you knew what to do. You grabbed him and brought him to the van. Inside the van, he confessed to it all - and he confessed to more. Turns out, he was also responsible for the terrorist attacks of '49. YandreDev, using a new, highly complicated cum bomb, had caused a 200 ton brick of dried, boiled cum to explode in a train station - essentially acting as a massive, STD-ridden nail bomb. The immediate effects were the deaths of 1000 men, women, and children and the German authorities are still not aware of how many STDs have been caused by this. 

Finally, YandreDev reached the pillar of Justice. Below him, an angry crowd of people screamed, demanding his death, laughing at his misfortune. Trumpets blasted their holy sound as the King of Germany stepped out to view his arch enemy's death. German banners flew in the air and, with a king's single command, the guillotine landed upon YandreDev.
