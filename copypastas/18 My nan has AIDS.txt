Yesterday I found out that my nan had AIDS - she said it'd be all right because when she dies she'll go to heaven. Me, being the proud atheist I am, proceeded to beat the ever-living shit of my nan. Since then, I've taken pictures of my nan to post on r/atheism so all my atheist brothers can reward me with some sexy little gi- karma. Sexy little karma.
