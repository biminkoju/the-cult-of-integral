As the wheel spins,  
I hold a breath for my pillory.  
Wanna post, fag? Or paste your ASCII white cock?  
'Cause you'll never fuck me  
King of tarts, all in (all-in)  
It's not a sin to be in our kin (sin to be our kin)  
Can't see me cumming like an abuser; gay and Reddit energy  
I even cream in your dreams, naturally.  


I see a cummer over there by the vents  
But I got no, but I got no  
Claustrophobia, you cummy abuser.  
I see an imposter,  
And he's ripe for the slaughter  
But I got no, but I got no  
Claustrophobia, you cummy abuser.  
(Cummy, cummy, abuser)  


I hear YandreDev dreams of my demise, but I know, secretly, his cock hurts.  
I take a recipe of my own cooking  
Made with jizzies: the pasta is yearning.  
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh  
That's how it goes  
YandreDev's drafted the children; it's time:  
I see boy pussy in their eyes.

He's better off just fapping,  
(Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah!)  
I've got my own cum to sling  
It shoots loaded like a gun: white and jelly propel-y.   
Only my spunk and his blood left at the scene.

My balls are full  
Why don't you swim?  
Enjoy my juices, pussy, I'll be right in  
I stare at your hole through Yandre's soul  
We all know  
I can do this; pools closed...  
because I refuse to trim.  
So heed this cautionary tale  
As it happens, you've now got crabs, my little friend  
You'll conquer them in the end (if you can)
