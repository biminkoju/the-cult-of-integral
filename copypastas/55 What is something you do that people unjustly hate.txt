A lot of people hate me for doing a bit of light trolling and I do not understand why. For example, the other day I rang a charity and convinced them that I was dying of cancer, all the while using a voice changer to make myself sound like a small child. As the call went on, I dialed up the bizarreness, a bit like how Longmont Potion Castle does, until the charity worker was left crying. 

Personally, I don't understand how this a problem. It's not my fault that they started crying. They made themselves cry. I mean, how stupid can people be. Do they really think that I can control the neurons in their brain to fire signals to induce the hormones that activate emotional distress and crying? How is it my fault that some workers are pussies? 

Furthermore, charities and anyone who donates to charities are worthless. Charities only exist to serve themselves and people who donate to charities only exist to make themselves appear good to others. For example, a friend of mine's mother died of cervical cancer at just 17-years-old, and that friend literally had the stupidity to donate to cancer research UK. Seriously, can people not see he's just trying to make himself look better? It's all an act.

Anyway, I don't know why people hate this, it's literally just trolling - people will spend ten hours a day on fucking Reddit being dickheads but the moment does a dark-humored routine they start crying and being dickheads even more.
