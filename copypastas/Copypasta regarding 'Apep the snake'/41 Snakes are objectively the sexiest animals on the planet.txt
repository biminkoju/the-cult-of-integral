Snakes are objectively the sexiest animals on the planet. For a start, they have no arms of legs, meaning they're a giant tube. This is hot as tubes are more curvy than objects that are not tubular - and snakes are pretty tubular in more ways than one! ðŸ˜Ž

Secondly, snakes mouth's can dislocate and stretch, meaning they can give oral sex to anyone, no matter how large or small their penis is! The snake is a helpful chad.

Thirdly, the snakes cloaca is much tighter than human pussy. For example, me and my snake, Apep, have had sex quite a lot and I can tell you this; the feeling of snake cloaca clenching down on the head of your penis is enough to make any man squirt semen straight into the slippery serpent!

All in all, I see no reason why snakes aren't sexy - tits aren't everything you know (plus their hoods are hot af).
