Ten strands of cum shot from the penis,

all ten strands sacrificed themselves for the human genus.

Nine strands of cum entered the vagina,

as one had fucked off; their goals in life were higher.

Eight strands of cum made it through the opening,

as one had been crushed by the pussy walls, merely left hoping.

Seven strands of cum charged towards the womb,

destined to create a life for the human zoo.

Six strands of cum battled and won against the white blood cells,

one had fallen in action, but they did really well to get that far.

Five strands of cum frantically searched for the egg,

but only four strands of cum could pick up on its scent.

Four strands of cum turned around the corner of the womb,

but only three stands of cum would make it there without being doomed.

Three stands of cum battled with each other in a selfish vein,

but only two strands of cum survived the fight to remain.

Two strands of cum now rushed to the egg,

but only one strand of cum had reached first, the other left to beg.

One strand of cum now stared down at the prize in tears,

to kill themselves for the birth of life; a noble deed we all hold dear.

Ten strands of cum started the journey together,

but only one strand of cum was left to wander the Earth alone, forever.
