Chorus A

Goodbye brightness,

my new enemy

You've come to say nothing with me today?

Because a sound loudly stomping

Took its seeds while you was awake

And the sound that was removed from your brain

Still is gone outside the vision of loudness


Chorus B

In peaceful nightmares, you walked with me

Long roads not made of cobblestone

'Bove the group one elements of a road sign

You straightened your collar to the hot and humid

When your nose was stabbed by the boom of a non-halogen sound

That put together the day, and distanced itself from the vision of loudness


Chorus C

And in the fully clothed sound you heard no animals, maybe less

Animals viewing with speaking

Animals viewing with seeing

Animals reading literature that eyes did steal

And everyone requested to not disturb the vision of loudness


Chorus D

"Intellectuals," heard you, "I do know

Visions like a healthy man shrinks

See your drawings that you might teach me

Give your legs that you may never reach me"

But your drawings, like loud sunrays, flew

And lowered in volume, in the droughts of vision.


Chorus E

And the animals stood and sinned

To the non-neon devil I made

And the lamp boomed in its compliment

In the drawing that it was not forming

And the lamp saw, "The drawings of the truth tellers are drawn on the high-class ground and tenement floors

And shouted in the vision of loudness"
