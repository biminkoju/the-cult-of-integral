Now as we know, it is been, uh, it's been hard living in America in the past four years. Our, uh, president, hasn't exactly helped anyone, haha. Uh, you know it's funny because people often say he somehow helped the North Korea crisis - haha, yeah, they really do that, yeah. He uh, he gave them and Russia a helping hand, but only a little helping hand, haha. Uh. You know, but in all seriousness, it's never a good sign when the president is so uh, out of touch, uh, that he thinks calling protestors rioters is uh, you know, productive. Yeah, maybe he'd be in more touch if he wasn't too busy grabbing pussy, you know. Uh. But, it's kind of weird, isn't it, because before Trump was you know, sworn in by the Russians, haha, um, other right-wing things happened too, you know? For example, in the UKKK they had, uh, Brexit, haha. That's why all their teeth are bad because they can't trade toothpaste with the EU, haha, yeah. But uh, yeah, it's been hard living in America in the past four years, especially if you're, uh, black. Yeah, it's weird because I don't actually think Donald is like Hitler - no, I uh, I really don't. It's like Frankie Boole said, Donald could never write a book, haha. Yeah but um, final thoughts it's good that we finally got the sex offender out of office, the statue of liberty was so disgusted she uh, turned green, haha. Uh. Anyway, now it's time for our next routine, enjoy.
