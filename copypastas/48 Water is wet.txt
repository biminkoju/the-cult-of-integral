"To be wet means you can make it dry." is an incorrect definition of the term wet. The term wet is more properly defined as, "to be in contact with any liquid".

The proper definition of wet allows for two fundamental proofs for the wetness of water (along with any other liquid). These proofs are logical and chemical proof.

Logically, it can be assumed that for an object to alter the attributes of another object, the object must have the attributes they are altering. As water can change the attribute of an object to wet, water must therefore have an attribute of being wet.

Chemically, water molecules in water are in contact with other water molecules. As the proper definition of wet clearly states that being in contact with any liquid is to be wet, water is therefore wet, as the liquid, chemically, is in contact with itself.
