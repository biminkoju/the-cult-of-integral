If you go into the nether without a chest plate on, the blazes should get horny at the sight of the player's bare chest and start glowing brighter. After this, you should be able to take a blaze rod and penetrate with them. This should be used as a way to produce and barter magma cream, as the blazes will get very creamy when you do this. After this, blazes should be tamed and follow you everywhere. Furthermore, they will attack other blazes out of jealousy and occasionally let out steam rather than smoke (because when they get wet, it evaporates due to their heat).
