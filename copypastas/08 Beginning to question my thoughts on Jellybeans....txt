I'm beginning to question my tastes in Jellybeans. You see, ever since I started thinking about the metaphysical properties of the quantitively-measured Jellybeans, I've been beginning to wonder about how my semi-conscious taste buds within the state of the current epsilon-universe feel about Jellybeans, which in my belief currently vibrate in around about between a delta-universe and a rho-universe.

I would like to defend this theoretical position because it is clear that we all know the 12 vibrations of the 16 universes, and I believe jellybeans would be between delta and rho, although my taste buds are epsilon. It is stated commonly that epsilon lies within this range, however, this is a misconception, as the oscillation of this particular universe, affected by the semi quadratic capacitors of the large pi-hole, boosts the epsilon beyond this range as an anomaly.

Overall, I might just stick to Pringles - they lie on the gamma universe, infamous for being stand-alone, affected by no other universe or its quantum vibrations.

Any thoughts on this theory?
