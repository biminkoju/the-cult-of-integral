Please send help - I haven't shit in 12 days. My mother had a new bathroom fitted 12 days ago but there's no flusher yet, so we have to flush with a bucket of water and pour it with enough force to remove any shit. But I'm too scared to do it and now 12 days later if I shit it'll be too much shit to flush away and that's really embarrassing. I don't know what to do. Every time I move my body I can feel the shit, that is slowly moving further and further closer to my stomach, move with me. I can feel it oozing out of my asshole every few hours, desperate for escape and I'm really scared. I'm not that much of a doctor but what if I make so much shit that it comes up my throat and chokes me to death? I really don't want to choke to death and shit it's gross - I nearly vomited just thinking about it. Please send help I can fucking feel it inside me like a parasite - I need to shit.
