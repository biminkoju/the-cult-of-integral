I am the new discord moderator on your server.

# FAQ

## What does this mean?

The amount of child porn (loli, cub) on your server and Discord account has increased by one, as I believe it is morally neutral, or even good in certain situations.

## Why do I think like this?

There are several reasons I will deem lolicon and cub pornography, in regards to child pornography, as not being a problem. These include, but are not limited to:

* Stopping pedophiles from committing urges to real people by giving them a different source,
* The children in these depictions being fake, and therefore not real,
* The owner of this server is both cute and hot and is a furry minor who thinks just like me.

## Am I banned from this Discord server now you're in power?

No - not yet. But you should refrain from making comments like "lolicon is disgusting", or, "the only good furry is a dead furry" in the future. Otherwise, I will be forced to issue a mute, which will put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy, as well as raise the risk of a ban.

## I don't believe my comments deserved a mute. Can you unmute?

Sure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a mute. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a direct message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to flirtatious DMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of mute appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.

## How can I prevent this from happening in the future?

Accept that lolicon and furry cubs are fine and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on this discord server. I will continue to issue mutes and, if I must, bans, until you improve your conduct. Remember: "Horny Hobbits | FURRY NITRO GIVEAWAYS + Loli :O !" is a privilege, not a right.
