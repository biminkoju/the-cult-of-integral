Issac Physics is a piece of shit website that locks you out of answering physics questions for fifteen minutes for answering wrong too many times to prevent "guessing." Bitch I'm not fucking guessing, your question is hard as shit and it's dealing with resolving vectors, so I'm trying multiple values for the two formulas (Fx = Hcos(), Fy = Hsin()). How is this fucking guessing, it's making educated predictions. Fuck this fucking website, it's 23:34 pm and you want me to wait fifteen minutes to retry your shitty question about a fly and a shadow - please fuck yourself. Who the fuck is Issac anyway, what kind of name is Issac - we're not in the fucking bible.
