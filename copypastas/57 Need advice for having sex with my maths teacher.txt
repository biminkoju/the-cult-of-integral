For context, I am fourteen years old in the UK. Recently I and my mathematics teacher have been going for coffees every week whilst discussing studying. I like him, he's six foot two and spends his time teaching mathematics and working out. I would invite him another and we soon formed a close bond. The other day, I wanted to tease him a little as a meme, so I sat on him in a suggestive position, although I wasn't too obvious.

At first, he was tense, and I eventually ended up getting embarrassing and just kind of letting all my feelings out. Anyway, I eventually stopped crying and he cupped my cheeks telling me that, if I wanted to initiate a sexual relationship with him, that is fine.

I don't know what to do now, so I'm asking every one of r/teenagers to give me advice. On the one hand, I do genuinely want to have sexual intercourse with him and make love, but on the other hand, what if it's a trap. What if he plans to secretly record us then expel me, or is planning to kill me. I know one thing, I know he can cup all of my cheeks - I'm just too much of a coward right now to let him...

Also, if I should do this, could anyone suggest any positions? I'm new to this and want to make him feel really special. >.<
