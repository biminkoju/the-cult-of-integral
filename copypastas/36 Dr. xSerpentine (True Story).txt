I was suffering from an anal blockage thing that was hurting pretty bad. The solution to this, according to Google, was an enema. Now, I am not paying for a fucking enema. However, noticing that my water bottle's head had a significantly smaller circumference than the bottle itself, I stuck the bottle opening into my asshole and used asshole physics to suck the water up. From there, I giddily went to the toilet, and, low and behold, my problem was fixed.
