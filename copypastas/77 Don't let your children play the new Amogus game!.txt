I am rating this application one star, as I believe it is a terrible influence on today's youth.

I am the proud parent of three wonderful, Christian children. My youngest of the three was bored the other day and begged me to install your strange game, "Amogus". I had no idea what it was and there were these weird little blobs that my son kept calling "sussy" but I let him play it since he had done all of his door-knocking this week.

A few days later I walked into my youngest son's room. He had fallen asleep from what I can only assume was exhaustion, and he had left his laptop on. However, when I looked at the laptop, all I saw was your stupid blobs from the game. But oh no, they had penises. Penises and breasts on a single blob. Another image I saw had two blobs having a sex party with a third blob whilst calling each other "sussy bakas."

I have reported your game to the store and I hope it will be taken down soon. This is a warning to other parents: don't let your children play the new Amogus game!
