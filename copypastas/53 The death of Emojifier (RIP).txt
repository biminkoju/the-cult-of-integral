The fat, neck-bearded Reddit admin's glistened a dull glare at the Emojifier bot. The bot, long championed as a hero, lay with two gunshots to the stomach, coughing every few seconds. The Reddit admin couldn't help but let a small grin slip his facade of an otherwise blank, empty expression.

"Why..." The bot coughed, "What did I do?" The Reddit admin coughed, preparing his speech.

"According to rule 69420, approved by chief gamer Keanu Weeds, you have broken our spam rules. Because of this," The Redditor paused. The rain and wind stopped howling, cars stopped passing by and the atmosphere became deaf. The Redditor, slowly, but with a sick tone of soft finality, turned to the Emojifier bot, "We have no choice but to terminate your account". With a "Dream-like" expression and a whisper, the final bullet rang loud in the air. The Emojifier bot was dead.
