I have a confession to make. For the past five years, my mother has been terminally ill and I have been making her cookies to make her feel better. It made her smile and feel loved, but it never warmed my heart.

You may be wondering why I didn't warm my heart. Well, I was lying to my mother. You see, she would always ask how much milk I used to make such delicious cookies, to which I would respond with some trivial amount. However, it wasn't milk. For the past five years, I've been giving my terminally ill mother cum cookies.

I don't know why, but the idea of my dying mother thinking that I'm a loving, caring angel makes me super hard when combined with the fact that I know I'm actually giving her cum. It should just be a stupid, petty prank - but for me, it is so much more. Every time I see cookies I let out pre-cum, I've been kicked out of seven shops and I'm banned from multiple cookie factories.

I want to put my cum in every cookie on the planet - just the feeling that you people will be consuming my cum without your knowledge makes me hard. As for my mother, she's none the wiser.
