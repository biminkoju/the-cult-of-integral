Every time I sharpen a pencil, my nipples get hard. The sheer excitement I feel every time I go to sharpen a pencil is unbearable. I can't go a single day without thinking about sharpening pencils and it has broken me. My life had changed completely single the first time I sharpened a pencil. My family has disowned me and I have been cast out by all of my friends because of my obsession with sharpening pencils. Its been almost three years now and my life is in shambles. I don't know how much more I can take of this. My only reason for living anymore is the joy of sharpening my sweet, glorious pencils. The end is nigh. I see no light at the end of this tunnel.
