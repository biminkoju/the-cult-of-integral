Kala is the anthropomorphic female cat from the hit series, "The Gummib채r show". Ever since I have seen the series, I've had non-stop dreams of Kala, all revolving around me having sex with her. I adore this character - she is cute, funny, and incredibly attractive.

It's gotten so bad that my parents have taken my pet cat away after I attempted to paint it blue in an attempt to match my idol. They said they've decided to call Birchall Trust but I don't care, as long as Kala is in the therapy room with me (in my mind, of course) they'll never split us up.

I don't even know why people hate The Gummib채r show when it has such a character - she really is amazing. Plus, she's slim and her black suit looks like something out of pornography - you can literally see her legs all the way up to her crotch before the animators decided to cover it up. I wish Kala could wrap those legs around my neck whilst her own "pussy" leaks into my mouth.

All in all, anyone who hates The Gummib채r show is gay, because how can you be straight and not be turned on by Kala?
