YandreDev clutched his chest, blood tricked from the cuts caused by the hateful words on his discord server. In a moment of pride and glory, he pressed the ban button despite his injuries. As the evil troll was banned, the YandreDev server cheered their glorious leader, showing him the utmost respect by spamming him with compliments about his looks, technical skills, and so on. YandreDev chuckled to himself.

Then, out of nowhere, sirens echoed throughout the server - a member of r/copypasta had joined. This was going to be a tough fight. YandreDev ripped off his pre-loosened and roared with the power of one thousand rejections from teenage girls on discord. Quickly moving his mouth in a highly skilled manner, his pointer zoomed to the ban button. However, the ever-evasive member of r/copypasta then sent another message, causing the ban button to move further up the screen.

YandreDev nearly punched the monitor in sheer rage, but he couldn't let the evil r/copypasta member get the better of him. Using his expertise, he moved the pointer back to the ban button and managed to click it this time. Rage soon turned to manic laughter as YandreDev sadistically moved finger slowly towards the enter button like a complete retard. Clicking the button, the r/copypasta member was banned.

This was YandreDev's last stand.
