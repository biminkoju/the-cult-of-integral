I was with my dad in Spain the other day on holiday. As we ate at the British Pub, a bunch of Spanish people walked in and had the nerve to speak in Spanish. My heroic dad then stood up and declared that foreigners do not belong in this country. Everyone else in the pub clapped as we all chased the Spanish foreigners away from Spain.

My dad is a hero <3.
