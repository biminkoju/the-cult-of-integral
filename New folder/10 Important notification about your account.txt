Reddit is a platform that enables users to express themselves and their opinions. Harassing, bullying, or threatening users can make users feel unsafe to do so. As such, we do not tolerate harassing behavior on Reddit, which can include but is not limited to malicious PMs, stalking/following other users to different subreddits, or continued communication despite clear warnings to stop.

Please familiarize yourself with Redditâ€™s Content Policy, especially our policy on harassment, to make sure you understand the rules for participating on Reddit.
