Hello, 25M here. I've worked at UNICEF for 19-years of my life in the middle east bringing food to starving children, stopping ISIS, and overall just saving lots and lots of human lives.

Anyway, some random person texted me saying I was an asshole, and this really put my head in a dump. I just can't work out whether I am the asshole or not. Sure, I've saved the lives of millions of people, but some guy on the internet said something and I just can not figure it out.

I also have a Nobel peace prize in science for reducing the cost of malaria blood testing for \~$50,000 to about 50-cents.
