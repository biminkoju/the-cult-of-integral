OK, just an update from the last post.

After reading the advice from a few helpful Redditors, such as "try all positions." I and the mathematics teacher finally found a position that works and we did it. It felt, weird. At first, it was painful and it felt like there was something massive inside of my body (which to be fair, there was) but then it felt more, I don't know, pleasurable, I guess?

Anyway, I need more advice because now he's crying. You see, he accidentally, "did it", inside of me. I don't want to say any technical terms because it's gross, but now he's crying? What should I do to comfort him, I'm only fourteen years old and I'm not used to dealing with adult things. Should I start by telling him that I still love him and that it'll be alright or what?
